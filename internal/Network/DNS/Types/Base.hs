-- | This type holds the /presentation form/ of fully-qualified DNS domain
-- names encoded as ASCII A-labels, with \'.\' separators between labels.
-- Non-printing characters are escaped as @\\DDD@ (a backslash, followed by
-- three decimal digits). The special characters: @ \", \$, (, ), ;, \@,@ and
-- @\\@ are escaped by prepending a backslash.  The trailing \'.\' is optional
-- on input, but is recommended, and is always added when decoding from
-- /wire form/.
--
-- The encoding of domain names to /wire form/, e.g. for transmission in a
-- query, requires the input encodings to be valid, otherwise a 'DecodeError'
-- may be thrown. Domain names received in wire form in DNS messages are
-- escaped to this presentation form as part of decoding the 'DNSMessage'.
--
-- This form is ASCII-only. Any conversion between A-label 'ByteString's,
-- and U-label 'Text' happens at whatever layer maps user input to DNS
-- names, or presents /friendly/ DNS names to the user.  Not all users
-- can read all scripts, and applications that default to U-label form
-- should ideally give the user a choice to see the A-label form.
-- Examples:
--
-- @
-- www.example.org.           -- Ordinary DNS name.
-- \_25.\_tcp.mx1.example.net.  -- TLSA RR initial labels have \_ prefixes.
-- \\001.exotic.example.       -- First label is Ctrl-A!
-- just\\.one\\.label.example.  -- First label is \"just.one.label\"
-- @
--
type Domain = ByteString

-- | Type for a mailbox encoded on the wire as a DNS name, but the first label
-- is conceptually the local part of an email address, and may contain internal
-- periods that are not label separators. Therefore, in mailboxes \@ is used as
-- the separator between the first and second labels, and any \'.\' characters
-- in the first label are not escaped.  The encoding is otherwise the same as
-- 'Domain' above. This is most commonly seen in the /rname/ of @SOA@ records,
-- and is also employed in the @mbox-dname@ field of @RP@ records.
-- On input, if there is no unescaped \@ character in the 'Mailbox', it is
-- reparsed with \'.\' as the first label separator. Thus the traditional
-- format with all labels separated by dots is also accepted, but decoding from
-- wire form always uses \@ between the first label and the domain-part of the
-- address.  Examples:
--
-- @
-- hostmaster\@example.org.  -- First label is simply @hostmaster@
-- john.smith\@examle.com.   -- First label is @john.smith@
-- @
