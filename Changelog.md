# 4.0.0

- Safety: Both 'decode' and 'decodeAt' must now consume exactly
  the complete input buffer or a DecodeError is returned.

  * The same applies to each complete message with 'decodeMany'
    and 'decodeManyAt'.  Any final encoded message segment at the
    end of the input buffer is still returned as the second
    element of the result pair.

- Bugfix: fixed incorrect decoding of TXT records, and corrected
  the associated test.

- Cleanup: More precise control over decoder error messages via
  'failSGet', which avoids the unhelpful Attoparsec "Failure
  reading: " error prefix.

- Cleanup: Simplified loop detection in name decompression, making
  use of a monotone strictly decreasing limit on valid "pointer"
  targets.

- Breaking change: In the "Decode" module, expose only the
  decode{,Many}{,At} functions.  The rest of the "Decode" module's
  functions are now internal, exposed only for testing.  These
  include:

  * decodeDNSHeader
  * decodeDNSFlags
  * decodeResourceRecord
  * decodeDomain
  * decodeMailbox

- Cleanup: Reworked Decode module structure:

    * Moved Decode.Internal to Decode.Parsers

    * Created a new Decode.Internal which is now exposed, and
      moved some functions there from Decode which are only
      exposed for testing, since they could not reliably be used
      except as part of decoding a full message.

- Feature: RRSIG support, we can now encode, decode and show RRSIG
  records.  This uses the new 'decodeAt' and 'decodeManyAt' API.

- New API: 'decodeAt' and 'decodeManyAt' make it possible for
  the decoder to get the current time, in order to decode some
  RR types (like RRSIG) whose full meaning is time-dependent.

- Re-export 'sendAll' and export 'encodeVC' for use with TCP.
- No longer using sendAll with UDP, UDP datagrams must not be sent
  piece-by-piece
- Removed socket I/O work-around for no longer supported GHC versions
  on Windows.
- TCP queries now also use EDNS, since the DO bit and other options
  may be relevant, even when the UDP buffer size is not.  Therefore,
  TCP now also does a non-EDNS fallback.
- The resolvEDNS field is subsumed in resolvQueryControls and
  removed.  The encodeQuestion function changes to no longer take
  an explicit "EDNSheader" argument, instead the EDNS record is
  built based on the supplied options.  Also the encodeQuestions
  function has been removed, since we're deprecating it, but the
  legacy interface can no longer be maintained.
- New API: lookupRawCtl
- New API: ODataOp, doFlag, ednsEnable, ednsSetVersion, ednsSetSize
  and ednsSetOptions make it possible for 'QueryControls' to adjust
  EDNS settings.
- New API: FlagOp, rdFlag, adFlag and cdFlag make it possible to
  override the default settings of the query-related DNS header
  flags.
- Breaking change: the decoded EDNS record no longer contains
  an error field.  Instead the header of decoded messages is
  updated hold the extended error code when valid EDNS OPT records
  (EDNS pseudo-headers) are found.  The remaining EDNS record
  fields have been renamed:

        udpSize  -> ednsBufferSize
        dnssecOk -> ednsDnssecOk
        options  -> ednsOptions

  The reverse process happens on output with the 12-bit header
  RCODE split across the wire-form DNS header and the OPT record.
  When EDNS is not enabled, and the RCODE > 15, it is mapped to
  FormatErr instead.
- Breaking change: The fromRCODEforHeader and toRCODEforHeader
  functions have been removed.
- Breaking change: DNSFormat and fromDNSFormat
  have been removed.
- The fromDNSMessage function now distinguishes between FormatErr
  responses without an OPT record (which signal no EDNS support),
  and FormatErr with an OPT record, which signal problems
  (malformed or unsupported version) with the OPT record received
  in the request.  For the latter the 'BadOptRecord' error is
  returned.
- Added more RCODEs, including a BadRCODE that is generated
  locally, rather than parsed from the message.  The value
  lies just above the EDNS 12-bit range, with the bottom
  12-bits matching FormatErr.
- Breaking change: The DNSMessage structure now has an
  "ednsHeader" field, initialized to "EDNSheader defaultEDNS"
  in "defaultQuery" and to "NoEDNS" in "defaultResponse".
  The former enables EDNS(0) with default options, the latter
  leaves EDNS unconfigured.
- The BadOpt RCODE is renamed to BadVers to better resemble
  the term used in RFCs.
- Added EDNS OPTIONS: NSID, DAU, DHU, N3U
- Decoding of the ClientSubnet option is now a total function,
  provided the RDATA is structurally sound.  Unexpected values
  just yield OD_ECSgeneric results.
- Breaking change: New OD_ECSgeneric EDNS constructor, represents
  ClientSubnet values whose address family is not IP or that violate
  the specification.  The "family" field distinguishes the two cases.
- The ClientSubnet EDNS option is now encoded correctly even when the
  source bits match some trailing all-zero bytes.
- Breaking change: EDNS0 is renamed to EDNS.
- Breaking change: lookupRawAD, composeQuery, composeQueryAD are removed.
- New OP codes: OP_NOTIFY and OP_UPDATE.
